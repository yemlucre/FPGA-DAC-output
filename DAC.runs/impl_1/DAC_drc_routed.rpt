2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net led0_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin led0_reg_i_2/O, cell led0_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net led1_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin led1_reg_i_2/O, cell led1_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net led2_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin led2_reg_i_2/O, cell led2_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
